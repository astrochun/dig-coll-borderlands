    "Jupyter Notebooks are effectively made up of \"cells\". We can start by thinking of each cell being equivalent to a paragraph on a page. There is an order in which paragraphs and cells appear, and that order matters. In Jupyter Notebooks, the cells come in two flavors and a single notebook (like the one we are working in now) with have both types of cells. \n",
    "+ The first is called \"markdown\", which is text, like you are reading now. We can use some syntax in the text to format the cells in particular ways. For example, we can create italic text by using the underscore symbol (\"\\_\") at the beginning and ending of the text we want to italicize. So when we write \"\\_italic\\_\" in a markdown block, it will show up as _italic_.\n",
    "+ The second kind of cell is a \"code\" cell, that contains computer code in a language like Python or R. This is where the fun comes in."
