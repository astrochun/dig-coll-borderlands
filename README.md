## Planning for python lessons

Data will come from UAL Special Collections OCR of borderlands newspapers, focusing on two timeframes:

+ 1915-1922
    + El Tucsonense, a Spanish-language, Mexican American newspaper published in Tucson
    + Bisbee Daily Review, a newspaper published in Bisbee, a mining town at that time
    + Border Vidette, a newspaper published in Nogales, Arizona, on the border with Nogales, Mexico
    + Phoenix Tribune, the first African American newspaper published in Arizona
+ 1941-1959
    + El Tucsonense, a Spanish-language, Mexican American newspaper published in Tucson
    + El Sol, a Spanish-language, Mexican American newspaper published in Phoenix
    + Arizona Sun, an African American newspaper published in Phoenix
    + Apache Sentinel, published by African American soldiers stationed at Fort Huachuca

The Spanish language titles are largely available at [http://www.library.arizona.edu/contentdm/mmap/](http://www.library.arizona.edu/contentdm/mmap/). However downloading text is a bit cumbersome. As individual pages of issues are shown, and only PDFs are available for download (not text).

English language titles are hosted by [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/).
2016-04-05 of _Bisbee Daily Review_ is at [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1916-04-05/ed-1/seq-4/ocr/](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1916-04-05/ed-1/seq-4/ocr/). A text file should be available at [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1916-04-05/ed-1/seq-4/ocr.txt](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024827/1916-04-05/ed-1/seq-4/ocr.txt), but as of 2019-10-15, this was unavailable (as was the XML version). A copy of the text is saved in data/bisbee-daily-review.
